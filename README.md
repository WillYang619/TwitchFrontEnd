Twitch project
This is a simpe website built by HTML, CSS as well as JavaScript. The navigation bar displays the current top 5 games on Twitch and there are 20 livestream pictures of the first games out of the five games will also appear as the main content. Once one of the games in navigation bar is clicked, JavaScript will send a rquest using Ajax to the server, reaching the database of Twitch. The server's response will contain information from teh database that can be collect and replace with the template prepared in JavaScript, leading to different 20 livestream pictures.

What does this project mean to me?
This is the work representing the early stage of my journey of becoming a full-stack developer, especially when it comes to the communication with back-end servers. From this project, I learned how to use Ajax to send request, including setting request header with specific parameters such as accept and client-id. Also, together with the manipulation of DOM objects using query selector, I learned that the response, which is string in JSON format, needed to be parsed so that the data can be managed in JavaScript.
